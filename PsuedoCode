K_Means_Algorithm(D, k, eps)

t = 0
Randomly generate 3 tuples of length 4 with random floats. Possibly in the range of possible values

repeat

t = t +1

Set C1 = C2 = C3 = empty (possibly a set since we need to add to this)

One RDD for all the data


for every observation in the data set:

    take the vector distance between that observation and each mean vector
    whichever mean vector is closest to our observation
    assign observation to cluster corresponding to the mean vector


(1,2,3,2,3,1,2,1).map( 1 => data).reduceByKey





for each group (we have groups 1 to 3):

    mean vector 1 = mean of all observations in C1



done:
3 new mean vectors



Requirements:

1. One File
2. No Missing values
3. All numeric measurements
4. Actual labels
